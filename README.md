ConfigMgr Web Tools

CMWT is a simple, ASP web application, which provides a browser interface to view and manage a Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager primary site.  The intent is to expose a subset of the features provided in the traditional client "admin console", rather than attempt to replace it entirely.  The current version is focused on being lightweight, responsive, and intuitive.  Not all features are fully developed.  Future development will depend on public interest and feedback.  Almost anything is possible to add or improve upon in this project, so if there's something you want or need, let me know.

There are a few files which invoke the "Canvas" JavaScript library for generating graphical charts.  This is not vital to the project, but included for convenience.  If you intend to use this project in a business environment, note that Canvas requires a separate license and compliance with separate terms.  The Installation and Configuration guide is included in the .ZIP archive within the "docs" subfolder.
