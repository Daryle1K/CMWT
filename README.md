ConfigMgr Web Tools

CMWT is a simple, ASP web application, which provides a browser interface to view and manage a Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager primary site.  The intent is to expose a subset of the features provided in the traditional client "admin console", rather than attempt to replace it entirely.  The current version is focused on being lightweight, responsive, and intuitive.  Not all features are fully developed.  Future development will depend on public interest and feedback.  Almost anything is possible to add or improve upon in this project, so if there's something you want or need, let me know.
