ConfigMgr Web Tools

## Update 03/27/2016 - End of Life

Based on zero feedback and zero traceable results on this project, I can't justify maintaining it.  I'll leave this online for another week. And then it goes bye bye.  If you downloaded it but haven't tried it yet, thank you for at least that much.  I appreciate the consideration.

## Overview

CMWT is a simple, ASP web application, which provides a browser interface to view and manage a Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager primary site.  The intent is to expose a subset of the features provided in the traditional client "admin console", rather than attempt to replace it entirely.  The current version is focused on being lightweight, responsive, and intuitive.  Not all features are fully developed.  Future development will depend on public interest and feedback.  Almost anything is possible to add or improve upon in this project, so if there's something you want or need, let me know.

There are a few files which invoke the "Canvas" JavaScript library for generating graphical charts.  This is not vital to the project, but included for convenience.  If you intend to use this project in a business environment, note that Canvas requires a separate license and compliance with separate terms.  The Installation and Configuration guide is included in the .ZIP archive within the "docs" subfolder.
